# SHOPCART - ECOMMERCE WEBSITE BUILT USING MERN STACK

# MONGODB, EXPRESSJS , REACTJS , NODEJS 

# MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS WEBSITE IS Create an e-commerce platform where users can easily browse, search, and purchase products without any problem .

# And coming to the stack which I used to build this web application Is MERN 
•	MONGODB - MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format
•	EXPRESS - Express.js is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js.
•	REACT - React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).
   It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the application state efficiently.
•	NODE – it is a runtime environment for the javascript 

# And this project is mainly divided into 3 parts that is client , server and  the database 
•	For the front end I used reactjs for building the user interface and redux for state management and react router for handling routing and navigation 
•	For the backend I used nodejs and expressjs for setting up the server where node provides runtime environment for server-side operations 
•	For the database I used a no sql database mongodb for  storing data 

# key features of the website

# WORKING :
Whenever  the client interacts with the website that is when he clicks on anything on the front end the react will send a request to the backend server
and there it is handled and  if it requires any details from the database it sends a response to the mongodb and then it again sends info to the backend 
and the server will reflect it on to the users interface and this is how it works .
